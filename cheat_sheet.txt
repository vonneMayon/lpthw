Commands (methods/functions) you can give to files

• close: Closes the file. Like File->Save... in your editor.

• read: Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.

• readline: Reads just one line of a text file.

• truncate: Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.

• write('stuff'): Writes “stuff” to the file.

• seek(0): Moves the read/write location to the beginning of the file.

w' for writing (truncating the file if
   it already exists),

'x' for creating and writing to a new file, and

'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes
   append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position).

+ modifier, so you can do 'w+', 'r+', and 'a+'.
This will open the file in both read and write mode and,
depending on the character use, position the file in different ways.
